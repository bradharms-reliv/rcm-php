@TODOs:

MUST:

SHOULD:
- fix or document that drafts of locations that never been published before or have been depublished have different resourceIds than when they get published and subsequent drafts
- double check the resourceIds change and stay the same properly across all operations and with respect to locations
- write doc explaining "fromIds" and why they were removed (include "link to thing that links to nothing")Â 
- document resourceIds and how they change and stay the same

COULD:
- Fill in "USER_FULL_NAME_UNKNOWN" which should show in parentheses after every user id on the log screen
