How did Reliv get started?</em></strong><br>In 1982, <a href=\"/our-founders\" data-mce-href=\"/our-founders\">Robert and Sandy Montgomery </a>met Dr. Theodore Kalogris, who had developed an advanced nutritional formula. After taking Dr. Ted’s formula, the Montgomerys wanted to share what they had found with the rest of the world. In 1988, the Montgomerys launched Reliv, a direct selling company with the stated mission to <a href=\"/about\" data-mce-href=\"/about\">Nourish Our World</a>. Dr. Ted’s formula would serve as the foundation of <a href=\"/p/reliv-classic\" data-mce-href=\"/p/reliv-classic\">Reliv Classic®</a>, the company’s first product, for which he would be granted a U.S. patent that same year. <a href=\"/our-founders\" data-mce-href=\"/our-founders\">Learn more about the Reliv story.</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>2. How long has Reliv been in business?</em></strong><br>Reliv International, Inc. has been operating since 1988.</p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>3. Why do I have to purchase Reliv products through a Distributor?</strong></em><br>Reliv Europe does not sell products directly to consumers. Instead, we enable Distributors to <a href=\"/start-earning\" data-mce-href=\"/start-earning\">build a business</a> and make a profit by selling the products. To maintain the integrity of&nbsp;our business model&nbsp;and ensure that our Distributors are able to build their businesses individually, the company does not sell directly to consumers, and all purchases must be made through Distributors. These Distributors provide ongoing personal, individualised service to our retail customers. If you do not have a Distributor, please <a href=\"/reliv-international-world-wide-offices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"/reliv-international-world-wide-offices\">call your local office</a>.<br></p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>4. What kind of guarantee does Reliv offer?</strong></em><br>Reliv offers and requires each Reliv Distributor to offer a 30-day, 100% unconditional money-back guarantee to all retail customers. Every Reliv Distributor is required to honor this guarantee. If a retail customer is dissatisfied with a Reliv product for any reason, the customer may return the product to the Distributor within 30 days for a full refund of the product purchase price.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>5. What is the difference between an Independent Reliv Distributor and Reliv International, Inc.?</em></strong><br>All Independent Reliv Distributors are independent contractors of Reliv International, Inc. They are not franchisees, joint ventures, partners, employees or agents of Reliv. Reliv International, Inc. is the corporation that develops, manufactures and markets Reliv products.</p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>6. How can you make money with Reliv?</strong></em><br>There are five ways to make money through<a data-mce-href=\"/start-earning\" href=\"/start-earning\" title=\"Start Earning\"> Reliv\'s compensation plan</a>. First, Distributors earn an immediate profit, called retail profit, anywhere from 20-40% by sharing Reliv with customers. Second, Distributors can generate wholesale profit when they sponsor another Distributor and earn the difference between that Distributor’s profit level and their own. Third, as a Distributor’s organisation grows and additional overrides are created, they earn percentages through the organisation’s overrides. Fourth, Reliv awards incentive travel and monthly cash bonuses for business performance. Fifth, at the Ambassador level, Distributors are paid to help others to grow their Reliv businesses.</p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>7. How much money do Reliv Distributors make?</strong></em><br>Individual Distributors’ income will vary. Some individuals use Reliv as a source of supplemental income, earning enough money for a goal as simple as making a car or mortgage payment, for example. Others operate their Reliv business full-time as their primary source of income. As with any business, the amount each individual makes will vary. <a title=\"2017 Income Disclosure\" href=\"https://reliv-static.s3.amazonaws.com/art/FlyersLetters/USCanada/IncomeDisclosure/IncomeDisclosure-web.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"https://reliv-static.s3.amazonaws.com/art/FlyersLetters/USCanada/IncomeDisclosure/IncomeDisclosure-web.pdf\">View our income disclosure statement.</a></p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>8.

What is the Kalogris Foundation?</strong></em><br>Reliv established the Reliv Kalogris Foundation in 1995 as a non-profit, 501(c)(3) charitable organisation in honour of the late Dr. Theodore \"Ted\" Kalogris who created the nutritional formula that would become Reliv Classic®, the company\'s original product. When the Foundation began in 1995, the primary focus was providing products to individuals in need throughout the United States. As Distributor donations increased and news of the mission spread, the Foundation’s vision became more global. Year after year, the Foundation’s efforts have steadily grown. What began as simply supplying product to a handful of missionaries working in the Philippines has evolved into the full support of more than 270 nutrition programmes in 10 countries. Today, the RKF feeds 42,000 people every day. You can learn more by <a href=\"/give-back\" data-mce-href=\"/give-back\">clicking here</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>10.

Do Reliv products cure any cancer, diseases or other illnesses?</strong></em><br>No. Reliv products are intended to provide balanced nutrition for a healthier lifestyle and overall wellbeing. Reliv products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. Although many individuals have benefited from consuming these products, individual results will vary.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>2. Can I take Reliv if I have a medical condition?</strong></em><br>Anyone with a medical condition should always seek the advice of a medical professional before beginning a nutritional programme. It’s also a good idea for anyone under a doctor’s care to have his/her physician evaluate the Reliv products to ensure the products conform to any current dietary programme.</p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>3. I am allergic to certain foods. Can I still take Reliv?</strong></em><br>Before starting on any nutritional programme, you should read the label to find out if there are any ingredients to which you are allergic. If you are unsure if you should consume Reliv products, you should contact your physician.</p><p><br></p><p><span class=\"normal\"><strong><em>4. What is LunaRich®?<br></em></strong></span><span class=\"normal\">LunaRich is a Reliv-exclusive non-GMO soy powder that delivers 5-10 times more of soy\'s key bioactive component than ordinary soy powders. <a href=\"/science\" data-mce-href=\"/science\">Learn more about LunaRich.﻿</a></span></p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>5. Can I take Reliv while I am pregnant or nursing?</strong></em><br>We have testimonials from many women who have consumed Reliv’s essential nutritional products before, during and after their pregnancies&nbsp;and they found that the products supported them through this time. However, you should show the products to your physician for approval before starting a Reliv regimen during pregnancy.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>6. How can I find out nutritional information about individual Reliv products?</em></strong><br>The nutritional panel of every Reliv product is available online for every Reliv country. Select individual products under the \"Products\" tab&nbsp;to find out more about each product.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>7. What is the shelf life of Reliv powdered nutritional products?</em></strong><br>After the products are opened, they are effective for up to 6 months if stored with the lid on in a cool, dry place. However if not stored under these conditions the product will deteriorate at a quicker rate. A “best before” date is printed on the bottom of each can.</p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>8. Are Reliv products all-natural?</strong></em><br>Reliv products are not considered whole foods, organic or all-natural. The products are classified as dietary supplements and not food. Reliv uses both natural and synthetic ingredients, therefore the products are not considered \'whole foods\'. We use synthetic ingredients to increase the potency or stability and to standardise the amount of nutrients per batch. All of the ingredients contained in the Reliv products are considered safe for human consumption by the FDA. We purchase them in powdered form from leading food ingredient companies and formulate them into finished products. Each ingredient is accompanied with a Certificate of Analysis and meets strict Reliv specifications.</p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>9. Are Reliv products vegan, vegetarian, Kosher, Halal and gluten free?</strong></em><br>We have a product for everyone! Many of our products are listed as vegan, vegetarian, Kosher, Halal and gluten free. For a list of ingredients in Reliv products, please visit individual product pages under the \"Products\" tab on our website.</p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>10.</strong></em><em><strong>&nbsp;Are Reliv products patented?<br></strong></em><a href=\"/p/provantage\" data-mce-href=\"/p/provantage\">ProVantage®</a>, <a href=\"/p/glucaffect\" data-mce-href=\"/p/glucaffect\">GlucAffect®</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"/p/reversage\" data-mce-href=\"/p/reversage\">ReversAge®</a>,&nbsp;and <a title=\"CardioSentials\" href=\"/p/cardiosentials\" data-mce-href=\"/p/cardiosentials\">CardioSentials®</a>&nbsp;are currently under U.S. patents. The first <a href=\"/p/reliv-classic\" data-mce-href=\"/p/reliv-classic\">Reliv Classic®</a> patent was issued in 1988 and has since expired, as has the <a href=\"/p/innergize\" data-mce-href=\"/p/innergize\">Innergize!®</a> patent issued in 1994, the <a title=\"fibrestore\" href=\"/p/fibrestore\" data-mce-href=\"/p/fibrestore\">FibRestore®&nbsp;</a>issued in 1996, Cellebrate® in 1997, and <a title=\"arthaffect\" href=\"/p/arthaffect\" data-mce-href=\"/p/arthaffect\">Arthaffect®</a>&nbsp;in 2001. In order for an invention to be patented, the U.S. patent laws provide that it must (A) have utility and (B) be novel and non-obvious over the prior art. The U.S. Patent Office substantively examines patent applications to ensure that patents are issued only for inventions that satisfy these legal criteria.</p><p><br></p><p>Reliv also holds three&nbsp;lunasin-related patents:</p><ol><li>A patent on lunasin\'s mechanism of action for reducing LDL cholesterol in the body. (2 patents)</li><li>A composition of matter patent on Reliv\'s LunaRich technology as it relates to its superior ability to deliver bioactive lunasin to the body.</li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong><em>11. Why does it say “proprietary blend” on the supplements facts section of my Reliv product label?</em></strong><br>The term “proprietary blend” refers to our secret recipe of ingredients. Dr. Theodore Kalogris and Dr. Carl Hastings spent years perfecting mixtures of ingredients in Reliv products. The mixtures make our products unique, so we call them proprietary.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>12. Does Reliv source soy or any other ingredients from Monsanto?</em></strong><br>No. Reliv has never done any business with Monsanto.<br></p><p><br><em><strong>13.&nbsp;Is the soy used in Reliv products non-GMO?</strong></em><br>Reliv uses only non-GMO soy in our products. We do not accept the soy into our warehouse unless it comes with a certificate of analysis confirming that it is non-GMO and we only order from reputable vendors with whom we have established business relationships with. If the certificate of analysis does not confirm it is non-GMO, then the soy is rejected.</p><p><br><em><strong>14.&nbsp;Why are the products not labelled as non GMO?</strong></em><br>When it comes to adding non-GMO in front of the soy and corn products we use, regulations vary from country to country. In the UK for instance, the UK Food Standards Agency has expressed that until new EU regulations are agreed upon, that they would prefer manufacturers not use the GM free/Non-GMO claim unless the product can be proven to be 100% GMO free. While Reliv has chosen to use non-GMO ingredients in our products and while we strive to avoid using raw materials that contain traces of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO), it is virtually impossible to be completely 100% GMO-free. This is due to wind and other weather conditions despite the farming community’s best efforts.<br></p><p><br></p><p>We understand that some companies have chosen to push the limits when it comes to non-GMO labelling. Reliv chooses to take a conservative and responsible approach in this regard.&nbsp; The products always test below the threshold of .9% that would require GMO labelling but we feel that by not labelling the products as non-GMO, we are taking the responsible path for our labelling. Reliv chooses to operate with the utmost integrity while being fair and honest with our consumers.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>We continue to monitor labelling requirements and should the EU develop a harmonised approach to non-GMO labelling, we will certainly make any necessary label changes as needed.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em><strong>15.
