Future plan TODO list for the rcm-core-repo
- move site-settings-sections/src/HttpGetSiteSettingsSectionController.php to node
- move site-settings-sections/src/HttpPutSiteSettingsSectionController.php to node
- delete any site-settings-sections administration functionality no longer needed in PHP
- Make the "lock icon editor" and "page rendering ACL" use the NEW ACL system (or at least not use the old one)
- LASTLY: Delete the old ACL system, including the old "isAllowed" services
